# Laptimes-Leaderboard

This simple utility tracks laptime submissions from racing games and displays it on a leaderboard refreshed every 10 seconds. It consists of a Ruby on Rails app for the server-side and a Python client running inside or alongside the racing game of choice.

Since the Rails server just accepts HTTP POST requests, one could even use this for real-life racing if the vehicle had real-time capability to send POSTs.
